## About the Video Course
This course will quickly get you past the fundamentals of TensorFlow and you'll then go on to more exciting things such as implementing a variety of image recognition tasks. We will not only get you up-and-running with deep learning but also equip you with the skills to implement your own neural networks and apply them to the real world..
